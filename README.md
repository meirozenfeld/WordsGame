**Drink or Word** is a fun and interactive word game inspired by the classic *Categories* (a.k.a. *City–Country–River*) game — with a modern, playful twist 🍸.  
You can play solo or with friends, test your creativity under time pressure, and maybe even take a sip when you get stuck 😉.

## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

In each round:
1. A **letter** and a **category** (e.g., "Animal", "Country", "Food") are randomly selected.  
2. You have a limited time to say a word that matches both!  
3. When time runs out, a **buzzer sound** alerts players that the round is over.  
4. If someone fails to answer on time... well, they’ll need to **take a drink** (water or alcohol — 18+ only 😉).
